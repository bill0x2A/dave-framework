### A humble and unnecessary JS frontend framework

This is a personal project to try and learn the underlying complexity handled by the frameworks I have become accustomed to using.
Building one yourself is surely the best way to gain appreciation for what you **don't** have to do when using React / Vue etc.

###  Scripts
- `npm install` To install dependencies.
- `npm run build` To run webpack and bundle the code.
- `npm run serve` To start a local server with the test files.


### Bill's broken shitlist: 
 - Typescript

### TODO:

- [ ] Hot reloading for testing
- [ ] Fix Typescript support and compilation
- [ ] Handle `src` property
- [ ] Reactive state and DOM updating (lol)
